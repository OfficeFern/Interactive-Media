  <h1>Pick'em Ups</h1>
  <p>A social app that allows users to create and join pick-upgames of various sports</p>

              <h3>The Problem</h3>
              <p>One of the issues teens face when they move away from their childhood homes is making new friends. It can be intimidating to try and figure out where to or how to meet new people without being uncomfortable. </p>
              <p>So I was looking for a way to make it easier for these teens to connect with others that have similar interests or that just want to meet new people.</p>
              <p> However, I didn't want to just create a social website like Facebook, but something people could use for simply connecting</p>

                <h2>Design Issues In Research</h2>
                <p>When I was conducting research for this app the number one issue people would bring up was privacy. "What if someone has predatory intentions for younger teens?" one parent said. Or "what if there is a group of kids that like to bully one specific user when he joins in their game?" another asked. </p>
                <p>These were my hardest issues to deal with as I had to come up with something that wouldn't take away from the freedom the app gives like parental permissions before a user joins a game and so on. So in response to those concerns there would be a rating system put in place that increased as a user would play games. After the creator of a game has confirmed that the game has concluded a counter would be increasedfor all players involved to tell how many games the user has participated in. This would mean that players will be discouraged to join games that have low rating users as this is a warning.</p>
                <p> Another measure in place for these concerns was the communities tab. Now communities are a collection of users that have common interests when it comes to the type game they like or way a game is played. For example there could be a basketball community that is focused on competitive 1 on 1s while another is based around playing horse. </p>

      <h3>The Plan</h3>
      <p>So my idea took form of the app concept, "Pick'em Ups". Pick'em Ups is a social app that, in short, allows its users to create or find local pick-up games with other users, but I'll go into more detail as we go on.
To start off I wanted to create a easy to navigate home page so it wasn't confusing to younger users.</p>
        <ol>
             <li>So for starters I made sure to only have 4 or less tabs so there wasn't an overload of information making it confusing. </li>
             <li> I also wanted the most important information, (What games are happnening around you) to be one of the first things you see when you open the app. I based these decisions off of my persona that I had created called "Alan".</li>
             <li> <img src = "Persona.jpg" class = "img-responsive" style = "transform: rotate(270deg)"></li>
            <br>
            <br>
            <li> Earliest Sketches <img src ="UI%20Sketches.jpg" class = "img-responsive"> 
                The image above contains my earliest sketches that show how I wanted the home and map pages to resemble(most important pages)
            The friends and profile tab are more for privacy reasons that I'll talk about in the design issues. Later the sign up box in the home page will be moved to the greeting page that gets added. The markers will be color coded for easy identification and can be clicked on to expand and display information regaurding to the game.</li>
            <li> <img src = "Marker%20Sketches.jpg"> 
                <p>This is a picture of my sketches of the marker that would display for userswhen A game has been created. I wanted them to be simple, but informative so they are color coded for the game they represent as well as contain a ball that the game is normally played with for aesthetic quality.</p></li>
            <li> Below this image I have several other images that are more updated versions of the pages I first drew above.</li>
            <li> Yes, they are sideways and I apologize about that, but you can get a better picture of them when the window is at about half the size.</li>
